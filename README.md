# Why?
We are looking for high-performance team members. So, in order to know you a little bit we have created a challenge.

# The Challenge
We are looking to a way that allows us to fetch our favorites songs from Spotify, store, and filter inside our own app. Why? Why not!

## Brief
- The app must have a basic form with a "search field" and a button "search"
- When a user completes the album or artist name in the field "search field" an press the button "search". The app must connect to Spotify and fetch resources (albums and artists)  and store it in the app's database (model or table called "results")
- The app must display a list (or table) with results
